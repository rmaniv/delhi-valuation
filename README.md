# delhi-valuation
The quest to know the worth of Earth under New Delhi (India).
## version 0.1.0 (*under development*)
- [rough-delhi-lots.py](https://github.com/vinamrsachdeva/delhi-valuation/blob/main/rough_delhi_lots.py) extracts all lots within the perimeter defined roughly (not exactly) by all lots above 28.377060 degrees N, below 28.938108 degrees N, to the right of 76.722650 degrees E and to the left of 77.466205 degrees East, which is a rough square around Delhi. In order to run it, download the [391_buildings.csv](https://storage.googleapis.com/open-buildings-data/v3/polygons_s2_level_4_gzip/391_buildings.csv.gz) file from Google's [Open Buildings dataset](https://sites.research.google/open-buildings/#download).
- all-delhi-lots.py (*under development*) would interate through all the lots extracted from [rough-delhi-lots.py](https://github.com/vinamrsachdeva/delhi-valuation/blob/main/rough_delhi_lots.py), request a human-readable address from Google's Geocoding API's reverse geocoding address look-up feature and drop any addresses that are not in Delhi.
- delhi-land-val.py (*under development*) would be a Machine Learning land valuation model focused on pulling out land value from total real estate value better than the average real estate valuation model in the market.
- delhi-lot-value.py (*under development*) would iterate through all lots from all-delhi-lots.py, adjust for maximum ground coverage requirements of the government to figure out an adjusted lot area and multiply all lot areas with their (1) circle rates published by the government and (2) a rate estimated by delhi-land-val.py.
